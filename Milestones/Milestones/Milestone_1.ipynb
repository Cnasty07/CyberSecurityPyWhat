    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    " This project explores the functionality and applications of pyWhat, an open-source Python tool designed for resource identification. pyWhat analyzes text strings, files, and raw hexadecimal data to determine their format, encoding, or purpose. By leveraging a broad set of pattern recognizers, it can quickly classify hashes, IP addresses, cryptographic tokens, encoded data, and file signatures. This makes it highly useful in fields such as cybersecurity, digital forensics, and software development, where rapid identification of unknown data is critical. In this demo, we highlight how pyWhat simplifies the process of recognizing obscure data formats, showcase practical examples of its usage, and evaluate its versatility. Additionally, we discuss its limitations and contexts where alternative tools may be preferable."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of computing and cybersecurity, professionals often encounter unfamiliar strings of text, suspicious files, or raw hexadecimal dumps that require interpretation. Manually identifying whether these artifacts represent a cryptographic hash, an encoded message, or a specific file format can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where pyWhat becomes a valuable tool.\n",
    "pyWhat is an open-source Python utility that acts as a universal identifier, capable of analyzing text, files, and hex data to determine what they are. Much like the Unix file command but specialized for digital artifacts, pyWhat relies on a curated database of patterns to match inputs against known identifiers such as IP addresses, JWTs, Base64 encodings, ZIP headers, and more."

This is an Ethereum Wallet address. We also used the default filters and tags rather than adding complexities to this walkthrough.\n",
